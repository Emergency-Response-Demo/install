                 In the future this will be used to trigger automatic restore for a given KeycloakBackup. Each backup will correspond to a single snapshot of the database (stored either in a Persistent Volume or AWS). If a user wants to restore it, all he/she needs to do is to change this flag to true. Potentially, it will be possible to restore a single backup multiple times.
